# IMMORTAL
This project is a full-stack quiz application that was constructed with Node.js and Express and MongoDB for the backend and React for the frontend. Users can register, log in, take quizzes, submit their results, and see a leaderboard using the program. Multiple React components that manage various functionalities make up the frontend. By transferring their login credentials to the backend, users can register and log in thanks to the Auth component, which controls user authentication. A JSON Web Token (JWT) is saved in local storage for session management after a successful login. After the user completes the quiz, the Quiz component retrieves the questions from the backend, displays them to them, records their score, and sends the final result. 
In the meantime, the top 10 users by score are retrieved and shown by the Leaderboard component. Only authenticated users can access the quiz, according to the main App component, while unauthenticated users are presented with the authentication form.
A RESTful API that communicates with a MongoDB database via Mongoose is configured on the backend using Express. Endpoints for quiz questions, leaderboard administration, and user authentication are provided via the backend. For safe authentication, the authentication system generates JWT tokens using jsonwebtoken and hashes passwords using bcryptjs. To run my prototype please download code.py and run it with the flask library installed.
